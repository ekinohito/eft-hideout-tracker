Transform loot table from this document so that it becomes a typescript array with following type:
interface Item {
    url: string, // link to tarkov wiki
    id: string, // derived from pathname of the link
    category: string,
    name: string,
    iconUrl: string,
    isBarterItem: boolean,
    isCraftingItem: boolean,
    isAuxiliaryCraftingItem: boolean,
    questRequirements: {
        questUrl: string, // link to tarkov wiki
        questId: string, // derived from questUrl
        questName: string,
        quantity: number,
        inRaid: boolean,
        notes: string, // any additional info that wasn't contained in the previous fields
    }[],
    hideoutRequirements: {
        hideoutModuleUrl: string, // link to tarkov wiki
        hideoutModuleId: string, // derived from hideoutModuleName
        hideoutModuleName: string,
        quantity: number,
        inRaid: boolean,
        notes: string, // any additional info that wasn't contained in the previous fields
    }[],
}

i don't need any additional text, just typescript file. do not hallucinate, include only information contained in the original file. make sure to include every item
